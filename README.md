# XGBoost_Hotel_Prediction
Hotel Bookings Prediction Using XGB

Welcome to this code-along, where we will use XGBoost to predict booking cancellations with gradient boosting, a powerful machine learning technique! Through this, you'll learn how to create, evaluate, and tune XGBoost models efficiently. There will be time to answer any questions, so please add them!

The Dataset
The session's dataset is a CSV file named hotel_bookings_clean.csv, which contains data on hotel bookings.

Acknowledgements
The dataset was downloaded on Kaggle. The data is originally from an article called Hotel booking demand datasets by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It was then cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020. For the purposes of this code-along, it was further pre-processed to have cleaner ready-to-use features (e.g., dropping irrelevant columns, one-hot-encoding). The dataset has the following license.
